# Introduction to TypeScript

---

# Questions

1. Who is familiar with TypeScript?
1. Who has used TypeScript on a project?
1. What editor(s) do you use?

---

# Agenda

* Language Overview (demo)
* TypeScript Overview (8 slides)
* Tooling Overview (demo)
* Wrap Up (3 slides)

---

# Language Overview

^ Demo: Show basic language concepts from Atom

---

# Brief History of TypeScript

* Launched in October 2012
 * Open source project managed by Microsoft
 * Team lead by Anders Hejlsberg (Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C#)
* ng-conf 2015 Announcement
 * AtScript merged into TypeScript

---

# What is TypeScript?

* Superset of JavaScript
* Optional type system
* Features from the future (ES6, ES7)

---

# Dynamic Typing

* Variable type is interpreted at runtime
* Developer can provide less information
* Bugs are often discovered at runtime
* Reliance on unit testing to improve code quality

---

# Static Typing

* Variable types are known at compile time
* Compiler can perform type checking
* Allows bugs to be caught early
* Less reliance on parameter checking and some types of unit testing

---

# Tooling

* TypeScript Playground
* Atom - [https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* Sublime Text
* WebStorm
* Visual Studio
* NEW - Visual Studio Code (Linux and Mac OS X)
* And others (like Emacs and Vi)

---

# Rich Tooling Support

* Static checking
* Symbol-based navigation
* Statement completion
* Code refactoring

---

# Why Do We Care?

* TypeScript is just a tool
 * Increased productivity = happier developers
 * Higher quality solutions = happier users
* TypeScript is not for every project
 * Particularly useful on larger projects with multiple team members

---

# Flow

* Flow looks interesting
 * More aggressive than TS with implicit typing
* See Jesse's presentation
 * ["Flow is the JavaScript type checker I have been waiting for"](http://sitr.us/2014/11/21/flow-is-the-javascript-type-checker-i-have-been-waiting-for.html)

---

# Tooling Overview

^ Demo: Show Atom TypeScript features

---

# Wrap Up

---

# Learn JavaScript

TypeScript is not a replacement for learning the JavaScript language and its common design patterns.

---

# TypeScript 1.5 Features

* Support for Destructuring
* Support for Spread Operator
* Support for ES6 Modules
