JavaScript Admirers Presentation




Split apart language overview into separate files???
    If yes... then update the index.html file with additional includes




Do the language (or some part of it) first???

Update introduction slides
	Then and Now
		Then - There were 3... TS, AtScript, and Flow
		Now - Google is now using TS to build AngularJS 2
	TS vs Flow
		Flow looks great
		See Jesse's presentation
		Not trying to suggest that TS is better than Flow
		For some Flow will be a better choice than TS (or vice versa)

Review language overview code examples
	How much is the right amount of content???

Include preview of Visual Studio Code???
	Can you do debugging using Code???
	Does Atom TypeScript support that now???

Read up on Flow
	Is there any editor support???
